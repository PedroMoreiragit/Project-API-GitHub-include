# GitHub API Overview

The GitHub API allows developers to interact programmatically with GitHub's features and functionalities. It provides a way to access, manage, and manipulate repositories, issues, pull requests, and other elements of the GitHub platform.

## Key Features

- **Access to Repositories**: Retrieve information about public and private repositories, including commits, branches, and contributors.
  
- **Issue Tracking**: Create, update, and manage issues within repositories, allowing for better project management and collaboration.

- **Pull Requests**: Programmatically manage pull requests, including creating, merging, and reviewing them.

- **User Management**: Access user profiles, followers, and their contributions to repositories.

- **Webhooks**: Set up notifications for specific events, such as pushes, pull requests, or issues, allowing applications to respond in real time.

## How to Use the GitHub API

To use the GitHub API, you typically send HTTP requests to specific endpoints. Here are some basic steps:

1. **Authenticate**: You can use OAuth tokens or personal access tokens for authentication.
  
2. **Make Requests**: Use tools like `curl`, Postman, or your programming language's HTTP library to make requests to the API endpoints.

3. **Handle Responses**: The API returns data in JSON format, which you can parse and use in your application.

## Example Request

Here’s a simple example of how to fetch a repository’s details using the GitHub API:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO_NAME
